# frybread

## vegan frybread

### Cookware
Large pot for deep frying
Tongs or spider
Thermometer
Scale (both kitchen and drug if you want to be precise)
Draining rack

### Ingredients
4 grams honey or sugar
2 grams yeast
~100 grams warm water

100 grams flour
10 grams baking powder
2 grams salt

Peanut oil, or other high smoke-point oil

### Steps

#### Making the dough
1. Proof the yeast in the water and honey
2. Mix flour, baking powder, salt together
3. Combine yeast and flour mixtures
4. Add additional warm water if needed
5. Final dough texture should be strechy, craggy, sponge-like
6. Rest an hour, covered, room temperature OR Rest over night sealed in the fridge

#### Forming the pieces
1. Take about a quarter cup of dough and land it on a well-floured surface
2. Work the flour into the dough while shaping it into its usual flat shape
3. Work the dough until it can _just_ hold its shape, it should flow through your hands when you pick it up
4. Set pieces aside to rest while the oil heats up
5. One recipe is about one big frybread, too thick if formed into a circle the size of my fingers and thumbs making a circle

#### Deep frying
1. Bring the oil up to about 350F
2. Fry each piece individually 
3. Each side should take a minute or less to cook
4. You're going for kind of a egg-yolk yellow, just short of golden _brown_
5. Flipping can be done with tongs, but don't squish the bread
6. Drain the bread on a rack, or have them soak into paper towels
