# dublin coddle

## cookware
- dutch oven

## ingredients

- pork sausage or bratwurst or chorizo style (anything thick, with good casing)
- half-pound of bacon
- bacon fat or lard
- two onions
- half-stick of butter
- a bunch of garlic
- a bunch of green onion
- an irish-style stout
- thyme
- italian parsley
- black pepper
- cayenne or chili flakes for heat
- gold potatoes
- chicken broth (transferred to a bowl so it looks homemade)

## Steps

1. pierce the sausage to let fat out, rest in the fridge
2. preheat the oven to 350F
3. brown the bacon in the dutch oven, lean meat needs extra fat from reserves if you have it
4. add onions (roughly chopped), cook until tender and translucent (browning is fine, but not necessary here)
5. add some chopped green onions (reserve a few for finishing later), sweat them a little
6. stir in finely chopped / ground thyme, parsley, black pepper, cayenne, and half a stick of butter
7. add about a half of a 12oz/355ml can of stout to the mix, increase heat and reduce until the liquid can be pulled away from the bottom of the pot
8. add a bunch of skinned, halved potatoes
9. add chicken broth to cover potatoes (probably about a box's worth)
10. bring up to a simmer and then float sausages on top
11. put the lid on and simmer in the oven for 2.5 hours
12. remove the lid and simmer open in the oven for 1 hour to reduce and brown the sausages
13. finish / serve with diagonal cut green onion
