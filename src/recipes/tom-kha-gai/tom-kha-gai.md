## cookware
- mortar and pestle

- one large saucepan or pot
  

## ingredients

### First Fry

- 2 shallots (40g), peeled, finely minced
- optional: diced mushrooms
- rice wine vinegar for deglazing (alternative: any white wine vinegar)
 
### Then add stock / broth
- about a liter of chicken stock
- 500ml coconut cream (one of those smaller tetrapacks)

### Herbs & Spices & Chicken
- 1 tablespoons of fish sauce (~30ml)
- about a tablespoon of galangal, finely grated
- 10 count (~4g) mikrut lime leaves, remove middle rib (alternative: thai basil)
- 5 to 10 (5g to 10g) thai chiles, stemmed, smashed (alternative: six or seven jalepe√±os, cut into rings)
- lemongrass bundle, 3 stalks (~120g), remove tough outer leaves, split lengthwise
- about 1.5 pounds (700g) chicken thighs, boneless skinless, cubed

### Garnish
- limes cut into wedges for garnishing
- cilantro leaves as garnish (alternative: sliced green onion or chives)
- chili crisp also makes a good garnish

## Steps

### Galangal Stock
1. Heat on low about a third of the chicken stock in a small sauce pan
2. Take half the galangal, peel, mash with mortar and pestle until you get a coarse, shredded, not-quite-paste
3. Steep the galangal in the stock, mashing in the pot periodically, continue to steep on very low heat until it's called for in the soup

### Soup
1. In the large sauce pan, heat the rest of the chicken stock
2. Peel, and slice very thinly, the remaining galangal
3. Peel, smash the shallots
5. Remove upper half of lemongrass, tough outer leaves, cut inner core into long diagonal cuts
6. Add sliced galangal, lemongrass, a quarter of the fish sauce, and the shallots to the stock, bring to a boil
7. Cube the chicken thighs now if you haven't
8. Once boiling, add the chicken thighs
9. Let pot come back to a boil, and then reduce hit to a bare simmer, simmer together for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through
10. Pour the galangal stock through a strainer and into the soup, mash the solid bits to press out all the good stuff
11. Then stir in lime leaves, chiles, and coconut cream
12. Once mixed, remove from heat, add lime juice and remaining fish sauce
13. Garnish with cilantro (minced or not, your choice)

2. Chicken things
